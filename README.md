# House-Price-Prediction

Overview
This repository contains a House Price Prediction web application developed using Python, Machine Learning, and Streamlit. The goal of this project is to predict the prices of houses based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, and more. The application is designed to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to input data and receive predictions in real-time.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features for better model performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized key features and relationships in the dataset to understand the factors influencing house prices.

Machine Learning Model: Trained a regression model using techniques like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest to predict house prices based on the input features.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared score to ensure accurate predictions.

Streamlit Web App: Developed a web application using Streamlit to provide an interactive interface for users to input their data and receive instant house price predictions.
